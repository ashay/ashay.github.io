# Hello! ðŸ‘‹ #

My name is Ashay Rane, and I work in Microsoft's AI Platforms groups as a
Compiler Engineer.  I occasionally contribute to the
[Torch-MLIR](https://github.com/llvm/torch-mlir/) project, which translates
machine-learning models written in PyTorch to a form that can be used with the
LLVM/MLIR compiler framework.

I am a Computer Science major by training, and I have had the good fortune of
working either full time or as an intern at Google, Microsoft Research, Texas
Advanced Computing Center (TACC), Galois, Groq, Salesforce.com, SAP Labs, and
Symmetry Systems.

I enjoy learning about different aspects of Systems work, and I have previously
worked on building compilers, optimizing performance of scientific and industry
applications, and securing programs against side-channel attacks.  I have
dabbled in program verification, programming robots, and graphic design.

Outside of work, you'll find me clumsily riding my bike around town, trying to
juggle, relishing the cold but sunny outdoors, or enjoying a big bowl of
granola.

To get hold of me, please email me at
