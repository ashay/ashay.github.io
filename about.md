# Hello! ðŸ‘‹ #

My name is Ashay Rane, and I am <strike>helping build the compiler at Rain
Neuromorphics</strike> currently in between jobs.

I am a Computer Science major by training, and I previously worked either full
time or as an intern at Cerebras, Galois, Google, Groq, Microsoft (Research),
Salesforce.com, SAP Labs, Symmetry Systems, and the Texas Advanced Computing
Center (TACC).

I enjoy learning about different aspects of Systems work, and I have previously
worked on building compilers, optimizing performance of scientific and industry
applications, and securing programs against side-channel attacks.  I have
dabbled in program verification, programming robots, and graphic design.

Outside of work, you'll find me clumsily riding my bike around town, trying to
juggle, relishing the cold but sunny outdoors, or enjoying a big bowl of
granola.

To get hold of me, please email me at
[ashay.rane@utexas.edu](mailto:ashay.rane@utexas.edu).
